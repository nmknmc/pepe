## Pepe the Frog

Once upon a time in the land of memes, a green anthropomorphic frog named Pepe was born, all thanks to the creative mind of Matt Furie. Leaping from Furie's 2005 comic Boy's Club, Pepe quickly became the Leonardo da Vinci of the meme world, featuring in masterpieces like "Sad Frog", "Smug Frog", and "You will never... Frog". And if you thought Pokémon cards were cool, just wait until you hear about 'rare Pepes' – these babies were trading in the meme market like hotcakes!

In a whirlwind of fame, Pepe found himself embraced by protesters during the Hong Kong protests of 2019-2020, where he was welcomed with open (albeit webbed) arms. Today, Pepe continues to hop around the internet, making appearances on platforms like 4chan, Twitch, Reddit, and Discord, where he's transformed into custom emoji. So let's give a standing ovation to Pepe, the resilient meme-frog who just can't be kept down, spreading joy and laughter across the digital landscape
